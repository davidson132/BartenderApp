# BartenderApp
Project 1. Bartender app
This app allows users to look at a menu and order drinks from that menu. Once the complete order is submitted, the bartender will be able to view the queue and make the order.
The bartender will be able to look at the queue list and also add drinks to the menu. 
Users cannot add, edit, and remove drinks from the menu. 
TODO: Work on shopping cart, work on queue list, get login function working so that bartender and customers see different parts of the website.
